## Goedemorgen, Goedemiddag, of Goedeavond 🤝

I recently graduated with a Informatics Bachelor's degree from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. In my degree I have been mainly focusing on web development, with sprinkles of data mining and data science. All the courses I've studied throughout my degree can be found in my [collective repository](https://github.com/Furdook/NTNU) along with relevant codebases and code snippets. Predominantly focused on React developent and a love for CSS, with a recently sparked interest in Vue.js and its surrounding ecosystem ☘️


### FurGroove 🦊
For the past year I've been volunteering as a web developer for this Dutch event organiser, creating their informational webpage for attendees. After multiple iterations and three separate event websites, we now have a collective page for all relevant information

This repository can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Furdook/furgroove), and is built in Next.js, using TailwindCSS
