## Goedemorgen, Goedemiddag, of Goedeavond 🤝

I am currently studying the final semester of my Informatics Bachelor's degree at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. In my degree I have been mainly focusing on web development, with sprinkles of data mining and data science. All the courses I've studied throughout my degree can be found in my [collective repository](https://github.com/Furdook/NTNU) along with relevant codebases and code snippets.

### FurGroove 🦊
For the past year I've been volunteering as a web developer for this Dutch event organiser, creating their informational webpage for attendees. After multiple iterations and three separate event websites, we now have a collective page for all relevant information
